- Readme
	- Especially about dictionary files

- Check correspondence with JS version, esp:
	- Date Checker seems to reject two digit years? (cf. check_date) -- confirm
	- Date checker operates differently (i.e. it may return more matches in JS version) this should not affect end result -- confirm
	- l33t matching is different here, test that I actually understand zxcvbn's implementation and that results are comparable.
